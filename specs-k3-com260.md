RISC-V Embodied Intelligence Full-Function Development Kit
The SpacemiT K3-CoM260 Developer Kit integrates an 8-core general-purpose CPU and an 8-core AI CPU into a compact core module and reference carrier, providing up to 60 TOPS of AI computing power and 130 KDMIPS of general-purpose computing power. It can smoothly run large models with up to 30 billion parameters, making it a complete development and verification platform for edge AI. Based on the RISC-V architecture, the kit supports the deployment of mainstream AI models and follows standard CPU programming paradigms, enabling zero-cost migration of AI algorithms. It is also hardware-compatible with Jetson Orin Nano, making it suitable for the engineering deployment of AI all-in-one machines, service robots, and edge autonomous intelligent agents.
